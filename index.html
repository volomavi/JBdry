          Finally! It's starting to get sunnier and feel a bit warmer! It may
          have taken a while but it's that time of the year to get your shortest
          shorts and tank tops out from the back of the closet and stock up on
          sun lotion.

        <h2>JB's Tip of the Week</h2>
        <h3>Tips for fueling during a run</h3>
        <p>
          Running is a simple sport. We put on some shorts and a tee, lace up
          our shoes and head out the door. But do we stop to think about
          hydration and nutrition in the same way that our km splits occupy our
          brain. Here's some tips on how to hydrate and eat fuel on a run.
        </p>
        <h3>Hydration</h3>
        <p>
          Keeping well hydrated is essential for maximum performance, to prevent
          cramping, improve recovery and help keep you focused. Take small sips
          often. This helps maintain your hydration and doesn't stress your
          stomach when you become thirsty and guzzle down half a bottle. Hydrate
          with electrolytes (as well as water). This will help replace
          electrolytes you are losing as you sweat (mainly salt). This will
          prevent cramping, and other more scientific problems. Hydrate all
          year. Adjust your hydration levels based on the temperature. Obviously
          when it's hot you need to drink...a lot! But you still need to drink
          in cold conditions, because you're still sweating.

        <h2>Trail Talk</h2>
        <h3>Lynn Valley: Norvan falls</h3>
        <p>
          An absolute classic route on the north shore for hikers and trail
          runners. This is a great trail for everyone! Runners looking to dip
          their toes into trail running will find a trail that has enough
          elevation to push yourself but be manageable, and experienced trail
          runners can utilise this to practise fast paced trail running or start
          their journey to more difficult trails.
